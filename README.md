This  game is currently live and hosted on verce , play it  here https://memory-test-game.vercel.app/.

## How to play the game 

The aim of the game is to remember as many orange box placements as possible in each level of the game .\

You have to press the start button  to start playing each stage of the game

Each level begins with the player being given the time to preview the orange box placements.

Then the player is given time to choose the correct placements during the select time

Should the play remember all the placement they advance to the next level, if they run out of time they lose the game

players are given three chances, if they choose the incorrect placement for more than 3 times they loose game 

good luck!!!
